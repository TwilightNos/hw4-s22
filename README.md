# HW4 consists of two parts

Please find corresponding instructions in the repo.

## [Part 1 in Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com)

Assume a table Emp(ssn, name, salary) of employee records, where ssn is the primary key. Assume the following characteristics:

- 400000 records
- Page size = 1000 bytes
- tuple size = 100 bytes
- directory entry size = 10 bytes
- No other overhead when storing data on pages.
- You can assume that there are no overflow pages in the hash index
- The queries always return a result

**Clarification**:
Assume that each page accessed is from disk (memory only has space for one page)
For questions that do not specify fill factor, please assume 100% fill.
For questions without indexes, please assume the file type as Unsorted heap


**Note:**  All questions in part 1 are designed to have just one numerical answer without decimals. In each of the below blanks, please enter only a numerical value (without leading zeros) as the answer. 

For example, say the answer to Question 1.1 is 1000 pages. Please enter "1000" in the blank (without the quotes). All the other answers like "1000.0", "A thousand", "1,000", etc are incorrect. We won't accept regrade requests if you enter extra characters.


Please find assignment named **HW4** in *Gradescope* and submit your answers. There are 23 questions in total for part 1.

## Part 2 in Jupyter

A written task for explaining access path in instabase.
